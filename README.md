my website
==========

this website basically exists for me to put my stuff up. i host it on glitch because i dont really have any appropriate web server available.

* set up separate pages for my shenanigans: photography, dev/engineering, music, videography, writing
* consider writing my own custom css framework to use instead of bootstrap, perhaps based on bootstrap. could also modify bulma
* set up the node http API to further help deliver assets
* mirror this stuff on github
